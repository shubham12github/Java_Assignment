Assignment on Java Variables and Data Types

1.What is statically typed and dynamically typed programming language?
-> Statically type: The languages in which memory to the variable is provided at compilation time itself 
   such languages are called statically type programming language.
   Dynamically type: The languages in which memory to the variable is provided at execution time itself 
   such languages are called dynamically type programming language.

2.What is the variable in java?
-> Variable is the name of reserve region allocated in memory and whose value should be varies during the 
   programm execution.
   Syntax followed in java to declare variable is:
   Type Variable_name = value ;
   here,
	Type-inducates the type of data stored in variable
	Variable_name-indicates the name of the variable
	value-indicates the value stored.

3.How to assign a value to variable?
-> value should be assign to variable by specifying a value followed by equal sign like " Type Variable_name = value"
   for eg. int a = 10 ;

4.What are primitive data types in java?
-> The data type which are predefined in language and is named by reserve keyword.
there are 'eight' primitive data types in java like byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char.

5.What are the identifiers in java?
-> an identifiers is the name given to package, class, variable, method, interface like this. Identifiers name must be 
unique.while dealing with identifiers name we must follow the different rule like:
	a.an identifier should begin with letters (A..Z or a..z), $ and _ and should be unique
	b.a keyword can't be used as identifier name.
	c.identifiers are case sensitive
	d.white spaces are not allowed in the indentifiers name.

6.List the operators in java?
-> Below is the list of operators in java:
	> Arithmatic operators
	> Logical operator
	> Relational operator
	> Unary operator
	> Assignment operator
	> Bitwise operator

7.Explain about increament and decreament operators and give an example?
-> Increament operators : it will increase the value by one number in that there are two types one is preincreament
   like (++a) which increase the value first then use it and other is postincreament (a++) which use the value first then 
   increase it.
   Decreament operators: it will decrease the value by one number in that also there are two types one is predecreament
   (--a) which decrease the value first then use and other is postdecreament (a--) which use value first then decrease it.
		for example- class Main {
 					 public static void main (String args[]) {
							int a = 12;
							int b = a++;
							System.out.println(a);	//13
							System.out.println(b);	//12
							b = ++a;
							System.out.println(a);	//14
							System.out.println(b);	//14
							b=a--;
							System.out.println(a);	//13
							System.out.println(b);	//14
   							b=--a;
							System.out.println(a);	//12
							System.out.println(b);	//12
							
							}
