1.What is the collection framework in java?
--> Collection Framework: It is the combination of classes and interfaces,which can be used
to represent group of individual object as single entity.

2.What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
--> ArrayList: 
I.In ArrayList Insertion operation based on index at any point is possible but not prefferred, 
  While performing insertion operation based on index  behind the seen shifting is happening 
  so this is not good approch that's why here index based accessing is not preffered
III.when our frequent operation is 'retrieving of the data' then ArrayList is recommended 
    because it implements RandomAccess interface. 
IV.To store the data in memory arraylist require contiguous memory location similer to array.

LinkedList:
I.In LinkedList insertion operation based on index at any point is prefferred because behind 
  the seen data is stored in the form of node and each node is connectd using link so no                  
  shift operation performed here. 
II.when our frequent operation is 'Insertion/Deletion' in middle then LinkedList is recommended
III.It didn't need contiguous memory due to data is stored in the form of node and it will exist 
    at anywhere where memory is available and connects with each other by the use of link.



3.What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
-->
Iterator:
I.Iterator traverse over collection only in one direction that is forward direction itself.
II. it is applicable for traversing over all collection classes.

ListIterator:
I.It traverse over collection in both direction that is forward as well as reverse direction.
II.It is applicable for traversing over ArrayList and LinkedList collection classes itself.


4.What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
--> 
Iterator:
I.It is used to traverse over newly collection classes as well as Legacy classes.Legacy classes 
  are such collection classes which released in early versions of the java.
II.Here hasNext() method is used to check whether next element is available or not and next() method 
   fetches that element if available.

Enumeration:
I.It is used to traverse over Legacy collection classes only.
II.Here hasMoreElements() method is used to check whether next element is available or not and
   nextElement() method fetches that element if available.


5.What is the difference between List and Set?
-->
List:
I.Insertion order is preserved.
II.Duplicates are allowed.
III.As many null insertion is possible. 
IV.It contains single legacy class which is vector class.

Set:
I.Insertion order not preserved.
II.Duplicates not allowed.
III.Single null insertion is possible.
IV.It does not contain any legacy class.


6.What is the difference between Hashset and TreeSet?
-->
HashSet:
I.Single null insertion is possible.
II.Both Homogeneous as well as Heterogenous data will store.
III.While retrieving data we can't predict retrieving order due to behind the seen it follows 
    Hashing algorithm.

TreeSet:
I.No null insertion possible
II.only homogenous data is allowed if we try to store heterogeneous data we get 'ClassCasteException'.
III.While Accessing the data it will accessed in sorted order.


7.What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
-->
Array:
I.Array can store elements of both primitive data tyape as Well as Ojects.
II.It is fixed in size once created we can't increase/Decrease the size.
III. Performance is fast as compare to ArraList.
IV.Least inbuilt methods are available for manupulating the data.

ArrayList:
I.ArrayList store elements only as Objects.
II.It is growable in nature.
III.Performance is low as compare to Array.
IV.So many inbuilt methods are available for manupulating the data.
