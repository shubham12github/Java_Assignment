Assignment on Operators and Loops

1.What are the conditional operators in java?
-> We have three types of conditional operators in java which mentioned below:
	1.Logical-and (&&)
	2.Logical-or (||)
	3.Ternary operator (?:)
  This operators are used to combine two or more boolean expressions.

2.What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
-> In java there are three types of operators based on the number of operands.
    1.Unary operator:It deals with the single operands eg.Increament and Decreament operators
	2.Binary Operator:It deals with the two operands eg.addion, subtraction,conditional operators
	3.Ternary opertaor (?:) which deals with three operands

3.What is the use of Switch case in java programming?
-> let's assume one scenario in which we have a one variable and now we want to do multiple operations on it based upon the 
   value stored in it in such scenario we use the switch case. it work similer to if else-if ladder statement.

4.What is the syntax of if-else statement?
-> if ( expression ) {
		//code
		}
	else {
		//code
	}

5.What are the three iterative statements in java?
-> 1.for loop
   2.While loop
   3.do-while loop

6.What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in java?at 
-> i have mentioned the priority level of arithmetic operation in java below:
   {} Curly bases-->[] Square bases-->() Paranthesis-->% Module-->/ Division-->* Multiplication-->+ Addition-->- Subtraction

7.What are the conditional statement and use of conditional statements in java?
--> There are five types of conditional statements in java which are mentioned below:
	1.If statement
	2.If-else statement
	3.If-else if ladder statement
	4.Nested if-else  
	5.Switch case
	This are the conditional statements which is used in java to control the flow of the program.

8.Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
--> for loop: a.recommeded to use when no of iteration is fixed.
			  b.iterates a part of program multiple times
	do-while loop:a.recommended to use when no of iteration is not fixed.
				  b.execute a part of program at least once without checking the condition and then iterates only when 
					expression returns true.

9.Write a program to print no from 1 to 10?
--> package com.pw.assignment;

	public class PrintNoFrom1_10 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int i;
		System.out.println("print the no from 1 to 10"+" ");
		for ( i= 1;i<=10;i++) {
	
			System.out.println(i);
		}

	}

}
