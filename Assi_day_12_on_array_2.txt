1.What is the default value of array for different data types?
--> Default value of the array for various data types  depends on data stored in it are as follows:
int a[] - '0'
byte a[]-'0'
short a[]-'0'
long a[]-'0'
float a[]-'0.0'
double a[]-'0.0'
char a[]-'\u000-Unicode value'
boolean a[]-'false'
String a[]-'null'
Object a[]-'null'

2.Can you pass the negative number in array size?
--> we can not pass the negative number in array size else we try then it leads to the result which shows the 
'negativearraysizeException'.

3.Where does array stored in JVM memory?
--> In java array are treated as object so it will stored in heap memory area.

4.What are the disadvantages of the array?
--> 1.we can not change the size of array once it created.
	2.It store only homogeneous type of data.
These two are the bigger disadvantages of the array.

5.What is an Anonymous array in java? give an example.
--> Anonymous array are the array which has no name and used for instance use only.
for eg. package com.shubham.core.java;

			//Anonymous array
	
		class Calc	{
		
			int add(int nums[]) {
			
				int result=0;
				for ( int n:nums) {
					 result=result+n;
				}
				return result;
			}
		}

		public class ArrayLec3 {
	
	
			public static void main(String[] args) {
		
				Calc obj= new Calc();
		
				int result=obj.add(new int[]{5,3,6,7});
				System.out.println(result);
			
			}
		}
In the above code we pass array instead of numbers this type of array are called Anonymous array.

6.What are the different ways to traverse an array in java?
--> There are two way to traverse an array in java as follows:
1.By using traditional for loop:-
	int a[] = {5,4,2};
	for (int i=0;i<a.length;i++ ) {
		System.out.print(a[i]+" ");
	}

2.By using Enhanced for loop:-
	int a[]={5,4,2};
	for ( int n:a) {
		System.out.print(n);
	}

7.What is the difference between length and length() method give an examples?
--> length:-
		This is the property by using this we can calculate the length of the array.
		for eg.
			int a[]={5,7,9,6};
			System.out.println(a.length);	// 4
		This snippets gives we output as '4' which is length of this array.

	length ():-
		This is method of the String class which gives the length of the string.
		for eg.
			String s= "Shubham";
			System.out.println(s.length());
		This snippets gives we output as '7' which is length of the string.
