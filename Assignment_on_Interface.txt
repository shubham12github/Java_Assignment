Assignment on Interface

1.What is an interface in Java?
--> An interface in Java is a mechanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of
class that contains only constants and abstract methods.

2.Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an Interface?Explain with an example
--> Only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.

3.What is the use of interface in Java?
--> There are many reasons to use interfaces in java. They are as follows:
a. An interface is used to achieve full abstraction.
b. Using interfaces is the best way to expose our projectâ€™s API to some other project.
c. Programmers use interfaces to customise features of software differently for different objects.
d. By using interface, we can achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance.

4.What is the difference between abstract class and interface in Java?
--> 
Abstract class:-
1.Abstract class have constructor.
2.Abstract class consist of abstract methods as well as concrete methods
3.abstract class does not support multiple inheritance
4.To make class as abstract we use 'abstract' keyword.

Interface:-
1.Interface have not the constructor.
2.The methods in the interface are bydefault 'public abstract' and variable are 'public static final'.
3.It supports the multiple inheritance.
4.Interface are bydefault abstract we need not to use the 'abstract' keyword with interface.
