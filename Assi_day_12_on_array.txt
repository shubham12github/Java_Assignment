1.What do you mean by an array?
--> Array is index collection of fixed no of homogeneous data elements.In array a single variable stores the multiple value 
so increases the readability of programm. 

2.How to create an array?
--> Array are created in two ways:
First one is:-
int a[]={5,2,3,4};  following this shortcut way we can create the array.

Second one is:- We can declare the array first then construct and finally initialize it
I.Declaration
int a[];

II.Construction
int a[] = new int[3];
here,we use new keyword because in java array is treated as object.while constructing size specification is compulsory.

III.Initialization
int a[] = new int [3];
a[0]=5;
a[1]=2;
a[2]=3;
a[3]=4;


3.Can we change the size of an array at runtime?
--> We can not change the size of an array at runtime.

4.Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
--> Yes,We can declare an array without assigning the size of an array but we have to specify its size before using it.

5.What is the default value of an array?
--> In java array is treated as object so default value for the array element is provided by the JVM depending on the type of
data stored in it.
for eg. int a[] =new int [2];
		System.out,println(a[0]);	// 0
		here,output is integer value because in this array int type of data is stored.


6.What is a 1D array with an example?
--> A single dimensional array is group of elements having the same data type which are stored in a linear arrangement under a
single variable name.
for eg.int a[]={5,2,7,6};
			Here,
				'a[]' is array of integer type which store the integer value like 5,2,7 and 6 in linear arrangement under 
				variable 'a'. 

7.Write a programm on a 2-D array?
--> package com.shubham.core.java;
	
	public class Array {
		
		public static void main(String args[]) {
			
			int a[][]={ {5,6,4},{8,7,1},{2,3,5},{5,6,8} };
		
			for ( int n[]:a ) {
		
				for ( int d:n ) {

					System.out.print(d+" ");
				}
				System.out.println();
			}

		}
	}
